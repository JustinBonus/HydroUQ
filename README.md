# HydroUQ

## Overview

The ``HydroUQ`` desktop application is a free, open-source software for simulating a building's engineering performance with quantified uncertainty during water-borne natural hazard loading (e.g. tsunamis and hurricane storm surges). The application's interchangeable workflow allows users to swap between popular uncertainty quantification methods to apply on previously deterministic models. Further, the modular design lets users drop-in their own building models (SIM), event types (EVT), nonlinear structural analysis (FEM), engineering demand parameters (EDP), and more while maintaining the full-workflow's UQ capabilities. 


## Capabilities

- Drop-in uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods like forward propagation, sensitivity, and reliability analysis onto previously deterministic CFD models using ``SimCenter UQ`` and/or ``Dakota`` backends
- Model experiments from validated wave flume digital twin
    - [NHERI Oregon State University Large Wave Flume](https://oregonstate.designsafe-ci.org) ``OSU LWF`` 
    - [Waseda University Tsunami Wave Basin](https://shibayama.w.waseda.jp/lab_en.html) ``WU TWB`` 
- Bathymetry/topography of the ocean floor and land surface for accurate wave propagation
- Shallow-water solutions (e.g., ``GeoClaw``) as boundary conditions to 3D CFD (e.g., ``OpenFOAM``)
- User-defined buildings for wave loading input and structural response output
- Design structures including Multi-degree-of-freedom (``MDOF``) model, steel building model, ``OpenSees`` models, and ``OpenSeesPy`` models
- Output probabilistic building responses, velocities and pressure at any point in the fluid domain
- Supports multiscale coupling by resolving areas of interest by with a two-dimensional shallow water solver (e.g., ``GeoClaw``) and/or a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver (e.g., ``OpenFOAM``) and coupling them at an interface.

## SimCenter Eco-System

The challenges of natural hazards engineering are addressed by the NHERI SimCenter through a suite of applications that provide cutting-edge tools for researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders. The applications are designed to work together to provide a comprehensive solution for natural hazards engineering. A puzzle-piece diagram of the SimCenter ecosystem is shown below:
