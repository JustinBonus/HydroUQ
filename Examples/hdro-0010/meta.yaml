summary: Forward sample a 2D wave maker piston's generated wave implemented in the high-performance Taichi Lang. The structure is a simple 1-story OpenSees frame structure. Engineering Demand Parameters are PFA, RMSA, PFD, and PID. The wave loading is generated using a stochastic wave spectra (JONSWAP). The wave loading is applied to the floors as lateral forces.
